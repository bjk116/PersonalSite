	<h3>Experience</h3>
	<p>During my time at Rutgers University, I worked part time at Kumon Learning Center where I accumulated over 1,000 hours of tutoring.  I tutored kids ranging from 4th grade to 11th grade.  The topics ranged from basic arithmetic all the way through Calclus 2 with integration and infinite sums.</p>
	<p>At Rutgers, I graduated with a Bachelors Degree with Mathematics and a disdain for how mathematics is taught in our public education system.  I believe that rote memorization of formulas is not the answer and insated stress understanding why formulas are true, which I believe leads to greater flexibility in the student to know when and how to use them.  I am a advocate of using real world problems to show why we solve things in certain ways.</p>
