	<p>Welcome to my site!  I'm Brian K.  I'm currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to develop my skills as a <b><em>full stack developer</em></b>, which I'm excited about.  I made this decision after parting ways with my former employer where I worked as a data analyst at a forensic accounting firm.  I currently tutor mathematics for students ranging from Middle School to College.  You can find a more detailed description of my services <a href="tutor.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Before entering the working world, I had attended <a href='www.rutgers.edu'>Rutgers University</a>, where I achieved a Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics.
