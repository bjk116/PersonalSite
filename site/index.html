		<p>Welcome to my site!  I'm Brian K.  I'm currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to develop my skills as a <b><em>full stack developer</em></b>, which I'm excited about.  I made this decision after parting ways with my former employer where I worked as a data analyst at a forensic accounting firm.  I currently tutor mathematics for students ranging from Middle School to College.  You can find a more detailed description of my tutoring services <a href="tutor.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Before entering the working world, I had attended <a href='www.rutgers.edu'>Rutgers University</a>, where I achieved a Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics.  I honed my tutoring skills during this time by working part time at Kumon Learning Center, where I taught middle schoolers and high schoolers topics ranging from basic algebra through Calculus 2.</p>
		<p>I currently looking for new full time employment as a Full Stack Developer.  I believe my skills in mathematics, previous experience with OOP in Java and Python make a suitable candidate.  You can find a copy of my resume and related technical skills <a href="resume.hmtl">here</a>  A page of my web projects can be found <a href='projects.html'>here</a></p>
